"""
1.Variables- variables are the container that store the values means it can take the refernce of the memory location of the value.for ex.,if we create x=10, x is a identifier and 10 is a literal, first 10 will be converted in binary format then this binary format will stored in a memory called heap by python memeory manager and x will take the memeory reference of that memory.
2.Tokens in Python- Tokens are the small individual units for building of a program. five types of tokens are-
 a)Identifiers-An identifier is a name used to identify a variable,function,class,module or other object.
 b)Keywords- A keyword are resesrved for special syntatic uses and are not use as identifiers.
 c)Punctuators-These are the symbols that used in Python to organize the structures, statements, and expressions.
 d)Operators-Python have some alphanumeric charaacters and characters combinations as operators.
 e)Literals-A literal is a number or string that appears directly in a program.
3.Assigning value to multiple variables- Assign multiple values or the same value to multiple variables. In Python, use the = operator to assign values to variables. You can assign values to multiple variables on one line.
 ex: a=b=c=10, then 10 will assign to a, b and c.
4.Python Casting- Typecasting means to convert from one data type to another data type.It is also known as conversion.
 a)Implicit casting- Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesnâ€™t need any user involvement Python promotes the conversion of lower data type.
 b)Explicit casting- In Explicit Type conversion, the user or programmer converts the data type of an object to the required data type.
