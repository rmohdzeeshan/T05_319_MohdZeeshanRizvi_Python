1.Python- Python is a high-level, object-oriented and dynamically type programming language.The code is easy to understand and develop so that's why python is gaining popularity among the progranmmers.

2.Features of python- Following are the features of python that why it is gaining popularity now-a-days:
  a) Simple- Python is a simple programming language. If we look into the codes of python we get more clearity and understand the codes easily.
  b) Easy to learn- Python programs are using simple structure that's this language is easy to learn.
  c) Open source- There is no need to pay for downloading Python. We can download it freely from the website.
  d) High level language- High level language use english keywords to develop programs. Python uses English words in its programs and hence it is called high level language.
  e) Dynamically typed- In Python we don't need to define any data type, it can understand itself only that's why it is a dynamically typed programming language.
  f) Platform independent- When a Python program is compiled using a python compiler it generates a byte code. python byte code represents a particular set of instructions that run on any of the ooperating system and hardware.
  g) Portable- When a Python program yields in any of the computer system or any of the operating system then it is called a portable program. Python program will give same result as they are platform independent.
  h) Procedure and Object-oriented- Python is procedure oriented(the programs are built using functions and procedures) and object-oriented(the programs are built using class and objects).
  i) Interpreted- A program code is called source code,then python compiler will compile this source code and translates it into a intermediate code called byte code. This byte code execute by using PVM,inside it an interpreter converts byte code into machine code.
  j) Huge library- Python has a huge library which can be used on any of the operating system like unix,windows or mac.

3.Python Virtual Machine- A python compiler can change the source code to the intermediate code i.e.,Byte code.Byte code represents a particular set of instructions and occurs 1 byte memory space. The role pf PVM is to convert the byte code instructions into the machine code so that the computer can execute those machine outputs to give the final result. PVM is equipped with an interpreter and this interpreter converts source code into byte code, hence PVM is also called an interpreter.

4.Memory management in Python- Everything is considered as objects in python. for every object memory should be allocated. memory manager inside the PVM allocates memeory requires for every object created in python program. All these objects are stored in a seperate memory called heap. Heap is the memory which is allocated during the runtime.The allocation and deallocation of memory to every object will be take care by the Python memory manager.

5.Garbage collection- garbage collector is the module in python that is useful to delet the objects from the memory which are not in used in the program.Garbage collector is the simplest way to maintain a count for each object regarding how many times that object is referenced or used. When object have some count, is is being used in the program and hence garbage collector does not remove it from the memory. When object reference count is 0,garbage collector will understand that it is not used in the program and hence it is deleted from the memory.Hence, the memory allocated for that object is deallocated or freed.

6. Difference between Java and Python?
    a) Java contains more number of lines as Python contains less number of lines.
    b) In Java, it is compulsory to declare the datatypes of variables but in Python, type declaration is not required.
    c) Java language type discipline is static and weak while Python language discipline is dynamic and strong.
    d) Java has switch statements while Pytrhon doesn't have switch statements.
    e) Java supports single and multi dimensional arrays while Python supports only single dimensional arrays.
    f) Indentation of statements should not be necessary in java while in Python Indentation is necessary.

7.Advabtages of Python-
  a)Easy to use and learn
  b)Expressive language
  c)Interpreted language
  d)Object oriented language
  e)Open source language
  f)Dynamic memory allocation
  g)Integrated
  h)extensible

8.Disadvantages of Python-
  a)Compare to other languages Python execution time is slow.
  b)It is not used in mobile computing and browsers.
  c)Underdeveloped database access layers.

9. .py and .pyc files- .py file contains the source code of the program while when compilation is done by the python compiler source code will be change to byte code, then .pyc file is created.
