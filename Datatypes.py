"""
1.Comments in python- There are two types of comments in python-
 a)Single line comments-these comments starts with a # symbole and indicates that the whole line till the ned be treated as comment.
 b)Multiline comments-when we want to mark several line as comment the writing # symbol in the begining of every line.The triple line quotes or triple single quotes are called multi line comments or block comments.

2.Data Types in Python- A datatype represents the type of data stored into variable or memory.The datatype which are already available in python are called built-in datatypes. The datatypes which are created by the programmers are called User-defined datatypes.
 a)Numeric datatype: the numeric datatypes represents numbers. Sub datatypes are :
    a.int: the int datatypes represents an integer number without decimal point or fraction like a=57
    b.float: the float datatype represents a number with decimal points like a=12.34
    c.complex: a complex number is a number that is written in the form of a+bj means combination of real and imaginary numbers.
 b)Boolean datatype: The booldatatype in python represents boolean values. There are only two boolean values True or False. Python internally represents true as 1 and false a 0.A blank string like "" is also represents as false.

3.Sequences in python: Generally sequence represents a group of elements or items.for ex, a group of elements will form a sequence. there are six types of sequence in python:
    a)str:str represents string datatype. A string is a group of characters.It is enclosed in single or double quotes.
    b)bytes:the bytes datatypes represents a group of byte numbers just like an array does.A byte no is any positive integer from 0 to 255(inclusive).
    c)bytearray: it is similar to byte type but difference is that byte type cannot be modifies but byte array can be modifies.
    d)list datatype:List in python is similar to arrays in C and Java. A list represents a group of elements.
    e)Tuple:A tuple is similar to the list. A tuple contains a group of elements which can be of different types.
    f)range datatype: the range datatype represents a sequence of numbers. The numbers in the range are not modifiable. generally, range is used for repeating a for loop for a specific number of times. 

4.CRUD Operations.
    Crud refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.
    Create- this function allows user to  create a new record in the database.
    Read- this function allows user to search and retrieve specific records in the table and read their table.
    Update- this function is used to modify the existing records that exist in the database.
    Delete- this function allows user to remove records from a database.

5.Explain about below functions and give examples 
	print() - The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
	id() - The id() function returns a unique id for the specified object.
	type() - Python type() is a built-in function that returns the type of the objects/data elements stored in any data type or returns a new type object depending on the arguments passed to the function.
	int() - Python int() function converts the specified value into an integer number
	float() - Float() is a method that returns a floating-point number for a provided number or string.
	complex() - The complex() function returns a complex number by specifying a real number and an imaginary number.
	bool()	- Python bool() function is used to return or convert a value to a Boolean value i.e., True or False
	input() - Python input() function is used to take user input. By default, it returns the user input in form of a string.
